**Inventory Management System using Java Swing and JDBC**

"TECHNOLOGY STACK : JAVA, JDBC(FOR ESTABLISHING CONNECTION), SQL(FOR QUERYING THE DATA FROM THE TABLE)"

**Step 1: Establishing Database Connection using JDBC**

In this step, you'll need to establish a connection to your database using the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API. You'll need to provide the database URL, username, and password to connect to the database. You can use libraries like java.sql to manage database connections and execute SQL queries.

**Step 2: Creating a Default Layout using Swing**

Swing is a Java GUI (Graphical User Interface) toolkit that allows you to create a user-friendly interface for your application. Start by creating a main JFrame that will serve as the container for your application's components. Add buttons for operations like inserting items, deleting items, updating items, and displaying items. You can use classes like JFrame, JButton, and layout managers (GridLayout, FlowLayout, etc.) to organize and position your components.

**Step 3: Displaying Items in the User Interface**

Allocate a section of your UI to display items. You can use a JList, JTable, or similar components to display the items fetched from the database. This area will show a list of available items, providing a clear view for the user.

**Step 4: Creation of Dynamic Table**

When you insert items into the inventory, they need to be added to the dynamic table in the UI. You can achieve this by updating the data model of your JTable component with the newly inserted items. This ensures that the UI stays up-to-date with the latest inventory information.

**Step 5: Filtering Items based on Category**

To implement item filtering, you can add a combo box or a list of categories to your UI. When a user selects a category, you'll query the database to retrieve items belonging to that category and update the UI accordingly. Use SQL queries to filter items based on categories and then update the UI components as necessary.

**Step 6: Error Handling and Validation**

Implement proper error handling and data validation throughout the application. This includes validating user input, catching and handling database connectivity issues, and displaying meaningful error messages to the user.
